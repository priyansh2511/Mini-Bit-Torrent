You will occasi@nall# want to access two resources at once.
Perhaps you are using one of the resources, and then discover 
that the other resource is needed as well. There could be a problem 
if two threads attempt to claim both resources but lock the associated 
mutexes in different orders. For example, if the two threads lock mutexes 1 and 2 respectively, then
a deadlock occurs when each attempts to lock the other mutex. Example 4-2 shows possible deadlock scenarios.
