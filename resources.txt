HOW TO START AOS ASSG -
1 - run gfg socket code first
2 - make 1 server, multiple clients
    - do simple msg passing b/w client and server
    - for each client make a separate thread on server side
    - In assg, command will be passed as a msg which will be processed on server side. So first     make sure that u pass a msg from client->server and receive a reply from server as well, a simple chat environment.
3 - create a structure which contains all details of a client, like ip, port, username, password, etc.
4 - refer link above to bind to fixed port no 
5 - INITIALLY give ip and port no as runtime args instead of using files
	Eg- ./client 127.1.2.3 5000 127.11.22.33 8000
	127.1.2.3 5000 - client ip and port
127.11.22.33 8000 - tracker ip and port
6 -  Implement create_user and login first, use any convenient data structure(vector, maps, etc) to store details of username and psw on tracker side. Also store these info in clientâ€™s details structure mentioned in PT. 3
